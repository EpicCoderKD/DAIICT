## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Real-time Transaction Monitoring
- Listens to all smart contract events
- Processes events asynchronously
- Handles event failures gracefully

### 2. Dual Storage System
- **On-chain**: Original blockchain storage
- **Supabase**: Structured database backup
- Automatic synchronization between both

### 3. Comprehensive Data Model
- **Users**: Addresses, roles, whitelist status
- **Batches**: Credit issuance, retirement tracking
- **Holdings**: FIFO lot management
- **Transactions**: Complete event history

### 4. Performance Optimizations
- Database indexes on all query fields
- Efficient event processing
- Batch operations for historical sync
- Memory management for event listeners

### 5. Security Features
- Row Level Security (RLS) policies
- Foreign key constraints
- Input validation
- Controlled access permissions

### 6. User Interface Enhancements
- Transaction mirroring status display
- Mirrored transactions table
- Transaction statistics dashboard
- Real-time status indicators

## Database Schema Details

### Core Tables
- **`transactions`**: All blockchain events with full metadata
- **`users`**: User information and role assignments
- **`batches`**: Credit batch details and status
- **`holdings`**: User holdings per batch (FIFO lots)

### Views
- **`transaction_stats`**: Event counts and amounts by type
- **`user_balances`**: Current balances and batch counts
- **`batch_stats`**: Batch information with holder counts

### Triggers and Functions
- Automatic timestamp updates
- User role synchronization
- Data integrity enforcement

## Transaction Types Monitored

1. **Issued**: Credit issuance events
2. **Transferred**: Credit transfer events
3. **TransferredBatch**: Batch-specific transfers
4. **Retired**: Credit retirement events
5. **RetiredBatch**: Batch-specific retirements
6. **WhitelistSet**: User whitelist status changes
7. **Paused/Unpaused**: Contract pause state changes

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
1. Supabase project with database access
2. Deployed smart contract
3. Node.js and npm installed

### Quick Setup
1. Install dependencies: `cd web && npm install`
2. Configure environment: Copy `env.example` to `.env`
3. Create database schema: Run `supabase-schema.sql`
4. Verify setup: `npm run setup-mirroring`
5. Start application: `npm run dev`
